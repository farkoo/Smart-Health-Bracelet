# Smart Health Bracelet

In this project, the goal is to make smart health bracelets for patients with special conditions. In the first version of this bracelet, the person's heart rate is constantly monitored, and if the heartbeat enters a critical and dangerous area, it is necessary to take the necessary measures. In these cases, it is necessary to inform the emergency center of the patient's bracelet along with his location to the emergency center.

In this project, in addition to the part that is responsible for the necessary processing and communication system as the brain, we need a sensor to receive the heart rate, a module for location and a module for sending text messages. For this reason, we have used the arduino mega as the main core, the KY-039 sensor to receive the heart rate, and the SIM800L module for approximate location and sending sms.

In the picture below, you can see the schematic of this smart bracelet.
